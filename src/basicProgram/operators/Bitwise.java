package basicProgram.operators;
/*
Bitwise basicProgram.operators in Java are used to perform operations on individual bits. For example,

=========================================
Bitwise complement Operation of 35
35 = 00100011 (In Binary)
~ 00100011
  ________
  11011100  = 220 (In decimal)
==========================================

Here, ~ is a bitwise operator. It inverts the value of each bit (0 to 1 and 1 to 0).
